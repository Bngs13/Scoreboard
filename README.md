# Live Football Scoreboard Library

* This TypeScript library provides a simple implementation of a Live Football World Cup Scoreboard. It allows you to start new games, update scores, finish games, and get a summary of ongoing matches ordered by total score and start time. 
* Graphical user interface has not been implemented as desired.
* Jest has been used as a testing library for TDD.
