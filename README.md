# Live Football Scoreboard Library

* This TypeScript library offers a straightforward implementation of a Live Football World Cup Scoreboard. It provides functionalities to initiate new games, update scores, conclude games, and retrieve a summary of ongoing matches sorted by total score and start time.

* A graphical user interface has deliberately not been implemented to adhere to the documentation's suggestion for maintaining simplicity.

* React libraries have been intentionally excluded from the implementation, aligning with the documentation's preference for a minimalistic library.

* Jest has been employed as the testing library, adhering to Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles to ensure code quality and reliability.
